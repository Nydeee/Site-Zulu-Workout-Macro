# Site-Zulu-Workout-Macro

# Instructions
1. AutoHotkey is needed for this to work.
2. Create a new folder, name it whatever you'd like and put the .ahk file in there. (This is needed so that the "BenchPressBot" file which is what allows the macro to remember where you want your borders to be is in one place with your .ahk file.)
3. Open the .ahk file with AutoHotkey
4. Hover your mouse over the top left of light gray box that you can see when you interact with the workout machine (bench, pull up, punching bag) and then click f9 to set the top left border
5. Hover your mouse over the bottom right of the light gray box and enter f10, you should now see the red box where the macro will scan for where/when to click space
6. Click f6 to turn on the macro and it'll do its thing.

# Extra Info
When you open up the macro for a second time, the macro saves where you put your search area (red box) last time. However, if you don't see that red box upon opening up the macro do not be confused, it's normal, the red box will re-appear once you toggle the macro again. 

A new file called "BenchPressBot" will open, don't be scared this is simply just there to save where you entered your search area (red box) from the last time you used it.
